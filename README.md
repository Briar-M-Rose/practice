# practice
This is a repository that I will be using to both validate and ideate on my progress as a developer!

I will be naming each folder for my work by the month it was done in, the project's start date, and if necessary by its order.

e.g. practice_oct_21_1

Here, the number 21 is representative of the date, whereas the number 1 represents which project of the day it was.
